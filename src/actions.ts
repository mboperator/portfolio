# About Me
● My goal is to build beautiful, well-architected products that make a meaningful positive impact on the quality of life of those that your company serves.
● In support of this goal, I have a decade of experience talking to customers, leading engineers, and shipping products that are used every day.
● My expertise is in JavaScript/TypeScript, but I know enough Ruby, and C to be dangerous. I’m confident that I will be able to jump into your preferred language, understand your design patterns, and move the ball forward for your customers.

# Professional Experience
Founder / Engineer, Totum Technologies (2019-Present)
● Leads product direction, design, and engineering for Ila Lantern, the Tesla Model S of camping lanterns. Currently being used by seven early adopters.
● Built Ila Lantern firmware and mobile application using an embedded event based architecture in C, React Native, and Bluetooth Low Energy. The app reflects the state of the lantern in real time and also implements OTA updates over bluetooth.
● Built Odyssey Journal, an encrypted journaling mobile app for closed country missionaries (React Native, Firebase, NextJS) Features real-time messaging and on-device NLP to surface users’ most journaled about people and subjects per week. Meaningfully used to share personal experiences by a handful of clients during COVID.
● Spearheaded product direction, design, and engineering for my local church’s community mobile application. The mobile app is implemented in React Native. The backend consists of two services: a Rails app for API & staff access, and a Matrix server to power messaging features. It is being used by a few dozen congregants on a weekly basis to make prayer requests, view announcements, participate in community discussions, and to watch sermons.
        
Staff Frontend Engineer, Procore Technologies (2019)
● Lead a team of four frontend engineers in architecting and implementing Procore’s Prequalification product from the ground up. Prequalification was in early release with over a dozen clients and a large waitlist. It was a major component in deciding to build the Preconstruction product line instead of acquiring a competitor.
● Coordinated and collaborated with the core frontend tooling team to implement complex form input components to be used company wide. Components are still being used and are part of the aforementioned CORE component library.

Senior Frontend Engineer, Procore Technologies (2017-2019)
● Lead initiative to rebuild the previously free Bid Management tool into a modern single page application. The redesigned product generated $1M+ ARR within 7 months.
● Lead two frontend engineers in rebuilding the Project Financials tool into a modern single page application, the cornerstone of the Construction Financials product line. We shipped in two quarters the product is still actively being sold and built upon.
● Spearheaded the CORE project, Procore's reusable React component library. Our goal was to incentivize adoption by placing a heavy emphasis on excellent DX. CORE has been adopted by the entire Procore organization (20+ engineering teams) and is still in active development.
● Built redux-modules, an open source library to quickly and declaratively manage state. Adopted by 10+ React clients at the time.
● Organized REBAR company-wide hackathon to enhance developer experience and tooling.

Frontend Engineer, Procore Technologies (2014-2017)
● Implemented Procore’s first frontend build pipeline (Webpack, CircleCI) utilized by the entire engineering organization (12 frontend engineers at the time, 20+ backend engineers). This pipeline handled both deployment as well as local development. Local development featured sourcemaps and hot reloading.
● Built the first multi-screen React SPAs (Custom Reports and Inspections), representing $10M+ ARR in 2019.
● Key collaborator and contributor to Project Zion, a company-wide 2 month UI refresh. We built the CSS, Ruby helpers, and served as guides to the Ruby developers as we updated the entire UI of the Procore platform.
         
# Community Involvement

Director, Connected Coworking (2022-Present)
● Lead the buildout of the coworking space, coordinating 15+ volunteers across three
separate organizations.
● Manages the day to day operations of the coworking space serving a dozen clients and three community organizations per month.
Intern, Redeemer’s Church (2020-Present) I serve the local church by:
○ supporting the church mobile application and website.
○ managing Yelp and Google Maps pages
○ creating videos for in-service worship.

Organizer, Hackathon by the Sea (2015-2019)
● Founded the mission, vision, and values of Hackathon by the Sea
● Collaborated with with the Ventura County Office of Education, Procore Technologies, and Hacker Fund to organize five hackathons serving hundreds of high schoolers across the Ventura Unified School District.
